## Repository Structure

### Red Teaming
Planned and designed threat actor emulation using TTPs, CONOPs and attack frameworks to emulate in detail an engagement operation.

### Malware Development
A collection of resources exploring malware creation techniques to better understand how malicious software operates, facilitating improved detection and prevention strategies.

### Social Engineering Tactics
Documentation and analysis of social engineering methodologies, helping security professionals understand psychological manipulation techniques used in cyberattacks.

### Exploit Analysis & Development
Resources for understanding vulnerability exploitation, including common vulnerability classes, methodologies, mitigation bypasses, and defense evasion techniques.

### Pentesting Reports
