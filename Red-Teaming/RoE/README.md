## üîç Target Environment Example

| Restricted | Authorized |
|------------|------------|
| IP: 10.10.10.0/24, 10.10.11.0/24 | IP: 10.10.12.0/24, 10.10.13.0/24 |
| Hosts: customer_workstation_1-1000 | Hosts: PII_workstation_1-1000 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Red Team Methodology

The methodology typically follows three phases:

1. **Get-In**:
   - Reconnaissance (OSINT)
   - Enumeration
   - Exploitation

2. **Stay-In**:
   - Post-exploitation
   - Lateral movement
   - Continued enumeration

3. **Act**:
   - Impact demonstrations
   - Data modification simulations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The RoE is a **legally binding document** - proper wording is critical
- All parties must thoroughly review and understand all sections
- Any modifications require written consent from all stakeholders
- The document should be reviewed with each modification request
- This serves as both a technical and legal framework for the engagement
