# Red Team Engagement: Campaign Planning & Documentation

## Overview

Campaign planning bridges the gap between client objectives/Rules of Engagement (RoE) and tactical execution. It transforms business requirements into actionable technical plans that guide the Red Team throughout the engagement lifecycle.

## Campaign Planning Structure

A comprehensive Red Team engagement typically consists of four distinct planning documents:

| Plan Type | Purpose | Key Components |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Engagement Plan** | High-level technical roadmap | CONOPS, Resource Requirements, Personnel Assignments, Timelines |
| **Operations Plan** | Detailed execution strategy | Operator Profiles, Intelligence Data, Specific Responsibilities |
| **Mission Plan** | Tactical execution details | Precise Commands, Timing Objectives, Operator Assignments |
| **Remediation Plan** | Post-engagement activities | Reporting Strategy, Remediation Guidance, Stakeholder Communication |

## Campaign Execution Phases
