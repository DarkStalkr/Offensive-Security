## Malware Development Life Cycle


1. Development - It is the first stage of implementing the scoped functionality within the malware.

2. Testing - Perform tests to uncover hidden bugs within the so-far developed code.

3. Offline AV/EDR Testing - Run the developed malware against as many security products as possible. It's important that the testing is conducted offline to ensure no samples are sent to the security vendors. Using Microsoft Defender, this is achieved by disabling the automated sample submissions & cloud-delivered protection option.

4. Online AV/EDR Testing - Run the developed malware against the security products with internet connectivity. Cloud engines are often key components in AVs/EDRs and therefore testing your malware against these components is crucial to gain more accurate results. Be cautious as this step may result in samples being sent to the security solution's cloud engine.

5. IoC (Indicators of Compromise) Analysis - In this stage, you become the threat hunter or malware analyst. Analyze the malware and pull out IoCs that can potentially be used to detect or signature the malware.

## Required Tools for Reverse Engineering:


1. Visual Studio - IDE where the development & compiling process will occur. Along with installation of the C/C++ Runtime.

2. x64dbg - x64dbg a debugger to get an internal understanding of the developed malware.

3. PE-Bear - PE-bear is a multiplatform reversing tool for PE files. Used to assess the developed malware and look for suspicious indicators.

4. Process Hacker 2 - Process Hacker is a powerful, multi-purpose tool that helps monitor system resources, debug software and detect malware.

5. Msfvenom - Msfvenom is a command line interface tool that is used to create, manipulate, and output payloads.
