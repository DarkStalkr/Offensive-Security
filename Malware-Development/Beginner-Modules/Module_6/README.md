# Windows Memory Management

### Virtual Memory & Paging

- In modern operating systems memory is not directly mapped to physical memory for e.g: (RAM), instead virtual memory addresses are allocated by processes then mapped to physical memory addresses.

- This is due to several reasons, one of the most important ones is to save as much physical memory as possible:
    1.  Virtual memory may be mapped to physical memory but can also be stored on disk.
    2. It becomes possible for multiple processes to share the same physical address while having a unique virtual memory address.

### Page State:

    1. Free:
        - The page is neither commited nor reserved, the page is available to be reserved, committed or both conditions at once.

    2. Reserved:
        - Page reserved for future usage, the page is not accessible & has no physical storage associated with it. 
    3. Commited:
        - Memory changes that have been allocated to the RAM and paging files on disk.

### Memory Protection:

- Most modern operating systems have memory protections to prevent exploits and attacks, here are some mecanisms:
    - Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
    - Address space layout randomization (ASLR)
