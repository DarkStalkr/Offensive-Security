## Repository Structure

### Red Teaming
Planned and designed threat actor emulation using TTPs, CONOPs and attack frameworks to emulate in detail an engagement operation.

### Malware Development
A collection of resources exploring malware creation from it's life cycle, throught their complex techniques to better understand how malicious software artifacts operate, facilitating improved detection and prevention strategies in blue teams.

### Social Engineering Tactics
Analysis and documentation of diverse social engineering methodologies, stemming from the psychology perspective throught the sophisticated fabrication of social engineering campaigns, aiding threat intelligence professionals understand the TTPs used in cyberattacks.

### Exploit Analysis & Development
Resources for understanding vulnerability exploitation, including common vulnerability classes, methodologies, mitigation bypasses, and defense evasion techniques.

### Pentesting Reports
Templates and examples of professional penetration testing documentation, including assessment reports, classification methodologies, remediation recommendations, and executive summaries.
