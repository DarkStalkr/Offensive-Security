# IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Referencing)


IDOR vulnerabilities occur when an application exposes internal object references (e.g., database keys) without proper authorization checks.
ID Manipulation:

### Encoded IDs: 
Developers often encode data (e.g., using Base64) when passing it between pages via POST data, query strings, or cookies. This ensures the receiving server can interpret the data.

        Example: Base64 encoding can be decoded using tools like base64decode.org, modified, and re-encoded using base64encode.org. The modified data can then be resubmitted to test for changes in the application's response.


### Hashed ID's:

- They follow a more predictable pattern, but are more difficult to work with in order to reveal the hashed value.

- Common algorithms used for hashing values in web apps, are md5 and sha256.

### Location?:

- The target we are looking for is not always seen in the address bar. But loaded via AJAX requests, or something referencing a JS file.

- Endpoints may have an unrefrenced parameters, due to some previous use during develpment stages, that got pushed to production.

e.g: 
You may notice a call to /user/details displaying your user information (authenticated through your session)

But through an attack known as parameter mining, you discover a parameter called user_id that you can use to display other users' information, for example, /user/details?user_id=123.
